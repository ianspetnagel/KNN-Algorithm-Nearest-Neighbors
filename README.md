# KNN-Algorithm-Nearest-Neighbors

For this project I am doing classification/regression using the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm on the Abalone dataset. This is a supervised machine learning algorithm. 

*From www.ibm.com/topics/knn*

*The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.*

The Abalone dataset has 8 features. Those appear as follows:

I am analying each data point's proximity to other points in order to deduce classification for each. This is my output after running the applciation.

For some of the data, the algortihms prediction did well to match, however, this was not true acrooss the board in reagrd to accuracy and correlation with the raw data. 

Also our training and testing errors were:

training error =  1.8494714777691794
testing error =  2.300551213332897

Given different inputs, the pedicted number of rings equated = 8.333333333333334. This can be seen in **3rd Output** above
